# Smart Drink Vending Machine

## Project Overview

The Smart Drink Vending Machine project aims to design and implement an advanced vending machine system that enhances user convenience, security, and operational efficiency. This project integrates modern technologies to provide a seamless experience for both users and service personnel.

## Features

### User Interaction and Payment System
- *User Interface*: Numeric keypad and LCD screen for selecting drinks.
- *Remote Purchasing*: Smartphone application and external website for managing drink selections.
- *Payment Methods*: RFID card readers, QR codes, barcodes, and NFC for versatile payment options.

### Product Dispensation and Collection
- *QR/Barcode System*: Generates and verifies QR codes or barcodes for collecting purchased drinks.
- *Seamless Interaction*: Efficient dispensation of selected drinks.

### Security Features
- *Burglar Detection*: Monitors and detects attempts to forcefully open the vending machine.
- *Alarm System*: Activates a buzzer upon detection of tampering or unauthorized access.

### Maintenance and Service Access
- *Access Management*: Service technicians and drinks suppliers use a valid user code to disable alarms and open the machine for maintenance and restocking.

### System Integration and Hardware Requirements
- *Hardware Components*: Includes RFID readers, QR/barcode scanners, numeric keypads, LCD screens, NFC readers, and security sensors.
- *Compatibility and Communication*: Ensures smooth interaction between hardware components and the systemâ€™s microcontroller.

## Project Scope

This project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of both hardware and software components. The goal is to create a robust, user-friendly smart drink vending machine system.
